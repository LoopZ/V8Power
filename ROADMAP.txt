Putting the power of an 8-cylinder engine under the hood of DOS batch files.

===============================================================================

Probable roadmap for the future of V8Power Tools:

    vfdutil - allow /m to accept root directory or just drive
    vfdutil - freespace output using same factor as /r input (ie K, M, etc)
    vline - additional options like smart and vertical
    vinfo - more system information provided by utility.
    vstr - Like trim, squeeze, implode, explode...
    vecho - Word wrapping and more control-code ascii support.
    vpcspkr - More music style support like maybe, C#, C. and such.
    vver - verify all utils are present and proper version.
    veach - duplicate checking and some other options
    vchoice - old style [Y/N] style choices

    vreadkey - Postponed, keyboard input.
    vchkbox - Postponed, Checkboxes.
    vview - Postponed, Text file viewer, user license agreement and whatnots..

    vchoice, vpause, vask, vview, vchkbox - Mouse, Hot Key and button support.

    More range checking, prevent possible freeze/lockup when developer uses
    really bad settings.

    Migrate to new codebase design & layout, (v8-*.inc)

    Optimizations and byte squeezing.
