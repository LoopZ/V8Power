Putting the power of an 8-cylinder engine under the hood of DOS batch files.

===============================================================================

The V8Power Tools project is being designed in cooperation with
Jim Hall for the FreeDOS(TM) (http://www.freedos.org) operating system. It is
intended to expand the functionality of scripts written using batch files and
to provide them with a better looking user interface with increased
functionality.

===============================================================================

Compiling V8Power Tools

    Prerequisites:

        8086 or better cpu.
        EGA or better video adapter.
        FreeDOS(TM) 1.1 or higher (http://www.freedos.org)
        NASM for DOS version 2.11.08 (http://wwww.nasm.us)

    Compiling:

        Insure the NASM directory is in your path spec.
        Download the latest sources from http://github.com/LoopZ/V8Power
        Run the mkV8.bat script.
        All executibles will be placed in newly created BIN directory.

    For lazy people, like me:

        Precompiled versions are available at http://up.lod.bz/V8Power.

===============================================================================

V8Power Tools Tested Compatibility

    FreeDOS 1.1+

Limited compatiblilty of advanced features (no "set /p" batch support):

    MS-DOS 6.2 and 6.22
    PC-DOS 7.0, 7.01 and 2000
    DR-DOS 7.03
    DosBOX (i/o redirection or querying using stdout will NOT work)
    Windows 3.11 Shell
    Windows 98 Shell and Command Line
    Windows XP SP3 Shell (except vcursor)

===============================================================================

V8Power Tools Usage

Here is some basic information reguarding all utilities and how they operate.

    Options, values and hexidecimal numbers are not case specific /f white is
    the same as /F wHIte.

    Hexidecimal numbers may be prefixed with 0x to prevent them from being
    treated as base ten. (Example: 10 and 0x10)

    Spaces are mostly optional. /B7/f0 is the same as /B 7 /F 0.
    But, not / B7 / F0.

    To use a / or spaces in a value, put it in qoutes. Like "Jack and/or Jill".

    Use multiple qoutes to use quotes. Like "Jack's house" or 'Say "What?"'.

    Unless overriden, most utilities use the text attribute at the current
    cursor location.

===============================================================================

Here is color table used for all **/A**, **/F** and **/B** switches:

    Decimal     Hex         Label (Not case specific)

                that.  Probably, a box or line or something. You don't really
                need this option. Because, you can just redraw the box, maybe.

                    digit   Jump to selections using 1-9 (+0).
    /Q          Query for result. When the choice is made, it's text will be
                sent to STDOUT.
    /T seconds  Delay in seconds before the default item is automatically
                selected (0-3600). Note that even if the user navigates to a
                different item, the original default item will be selected when
                the timeout is achieved.
    /P n        Use polling mode and preselect item number n as the current
                choice. Note, any change of selection will exit vchoice and
                return 100+ the current choice number.
    CTRL-C      When specified and Control-C is pressed, will exit with
                errorlevel of 200.
