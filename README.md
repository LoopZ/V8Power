# V8Power
Putting the power of an 8-cylinder engine under the hood of DOS batch files.
***
The V8Power project is being designed in cooperation with [Jim Hall](http://www.freedos.org/jhall) and the [FreeDOSâ„¢](http://www.freedos.org) operating system. It is intended to expand the functionality of scripts written using batch files and provide them with a better looking user interface.
